# Algorithm-and-Design-and-Problem-coursework

This is my coursework for Algorithm and Design and Problem that I created in first year college. It is all created in C. It uses algorithms such as binary search and merge sort. There are four tasks to complete. All task's C files have been individually uploaded and the All_tasks.c file contains all the code for each task in one file. The Coursework Report contains my design ideas, the running time of each task and the test cases I used.
